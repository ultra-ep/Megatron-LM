# Megatron-LM with UltraEP Integration

This branch integrates [UltraEP](https://github.com/Dots-Infra/UltraEP) into Megatron-LM (`dev` at [e93814b4](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/commit/e93814b4c6965c3f8639abdf690416c08937f370)) for online expert load balancing in large-scale MoE training. UltraEP keeps the main balancing controls, and requires minimal (several hundred lines) code changes on Megatron-LM.

For setup instructions, full usage details, and runnable examples, refer to the [UltraEP repository](https://github.com/Dots-Infra/UltraEP). Most performance tuning is controlled by `ULTRA_EP_*` environment variables. Extra arguments on Megatron-LM side are:

```bash
--moe-enable-ultraep
--moe-num-redundant-experts-per-rank <N>
```

## Dev Branch Philosophy

### Fast Iteration
- **Streamlined Review**: 1 code owner + 1 dev approver (can delegate review) + CI/CD

### Feature Lifecycle (Coming Soon)
- **6-Month Timeline**: Experimental features must graduate to stable or be deprecated
- **Migration Support**: Assistance provided for feature transitions

### Stability Expectations
- **Experimental Nature**: Features may change or be removed as development progresses
- **Testing**: All features will pass convergence and performance validation before inclusion
- **Support**: Dev branch issues should include `[DEV]` prefix
